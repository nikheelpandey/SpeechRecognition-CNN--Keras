# Speech Recognition

- This repo contains various methods that can be applied to make a speech recognition model.
- The train-test data is from kaggle's tensorflow speech recognition challange.
## CNN for speech recognition task:
- In my first attempt I've applied CNN as a classifier for speech data. The file[https://github.com/nikhilpandey360/Speech-Recognition-/blob/master/SpeechRecognitionCNN.py] contains detailed implementation.

### MFCC implementation due.
